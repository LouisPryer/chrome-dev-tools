# Chrome Dev Tools

Slides for my talk on Chrome Dev Tools presented at Holiday Extras during one of the lunch time brown bag sessions.
The focus of this talk is to highlight some awesome features in Chrome Dev Tools to enhance developer experience.

## How to get it running

I used [spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/) to generate the slides, using the [spectacle boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate) for initial setup

To run the talk locally, open your terminal and do the following commands:

```
1. npm install
2. npm start
```

It should then open up your browser under `localhost:9001`.

## Abstract

Chrome Dev Tools has some very powerful tools and features, which are constantly being updated.
This talk will highlight the panels in Chrome Dev Tools and what they each can do to enhance developer experience.
This talk is inspired by the Google IO Talk [Dev Tools State of the Union 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjjlwAvV8Jg) and the work by @umaar and his weekly [dev tips](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/) project.
